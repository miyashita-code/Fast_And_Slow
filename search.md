# Required Information

In order to create a comprehensive README for your Rementia system, I need access to the actual codebase. Currently, I only see a `.gitignore` file, which doesn't provide information about the:

1. Code structure and organization
2. Implementation details of the WebSocket connection
3. Knowledge graph construction
4. State machine implementation
5. UoT (Uncertainty of Thought) based closed question generation
6. Directory structure
7. Installation and startup process

Could you please provide access to the relevant code files? This would allow me to create an accurate and helpful README in English that properly explains the system.
